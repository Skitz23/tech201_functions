What is DRY?

Dry stands for Don't repeat yourself when you code you should keep the code simple.

Functions best practices

- Name your functions clearly using lower case and underscores
- All arguments should be clear in their need and where possible include in their expected type
- Remember the return statement or your functions will return none
- Keep functions small to preserve readability abd simplicity
- Use comments in your functions to give instructions on how to use them
-Consider using type hints to avoid type errors when you run your code

 
# Creating a function

def print_something():   
def = define
    print("Something has been printed")

print_something()

# The Return statement

def addition(int1, int2):
    return int1 + int2

 print(addition(2, 2))
